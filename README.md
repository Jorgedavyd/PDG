## Description:

## How to use:

If you are trying to run it cloning the repository, make sure your environment has the correct package versions and packages shown in `dependencies.txt`
If you are using the executable version, you can follow these steps as well.

1. Create a `.csv` or `.xlsx` with the columns `Longitude, Latitude, Presence` in that order.
   1. `Longitude`: Longitudes of the presence or absence place.
   2. `Latitude`: Latitudes of the presence or absence place
   3. `Presence`: 1 or 0 (1 if presence, 0 if absence)
2. Save the file on `./PDG/data` folder.
3. Now you can access other file rather than the example.
4. Execute `main.py`
